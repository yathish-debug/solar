# solar

This is a voltage prediction from solar panel for next couple of days using linear regression model (trained model using previously recorded weather (Bangalore) data.
Prediction is done using the data webscraped from weather forecast website

This repo consists of a file named weather_pred.ipynb, Where I webscraped the data for prediction
And a Soll.py where I used streamlit framework to deploy on website using Heroku (CAAS) platform
